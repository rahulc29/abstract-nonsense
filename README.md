# What is Abstract Non-Sense

In certain areas of theoretical computer science, it is customary and necessary to use subjects like category theory, type theory, domain theory, synthetic topology and constructive mathematics, among many others. I call all of these "abstract non-sense", in honour of category theory [[1]](#1) - the single most important and versatile of these.

# Why Care About Abstract Non-Sense?

The path to concrete insights makes a detour through the lands of abstract non-sense.

# What is this Repository?

At times, I find myself fortunate enough to be able to make sense of abstract non-sense. This repository aims to capture those moments through TeX. This is good for me - because I get writing and teaching practice. It might be good to others too, since some of these topics really do not have good expositions.

# Is the mathematics I write correct?

Generally speaking, yes. Most, if not all of the things I will be writing here I would've verified beforehand in Agda. For example, the current focus is realisability and a work-in-progress development of it exists at [[2]](#2).
